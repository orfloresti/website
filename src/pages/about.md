title: About Me
---

I am a software engineer focused on technological innovation, driven by a desire to understand how systems work and to develop solutions that combine efficiency, functionality, and value for users.

I began my journey with a bachelor’s degree in electronics, which gave me a strong foundation in problem-solving and systems thinking. Over time, I discovered my passion for software development — a perfect blend of creativity, logic, and the opportunity to build solutions that truly help people.

I’m self-taught in most of the technologies I use today and constantly exploring new tools and frameworks to stay sharp and inspired. I enjoy sharing what I learn — whether through mentoring, collaborating on projects, or simply exchanging ideas with other curious minds.

My main focus is frontend development, though I also have backend experience. I specialize in building clean, efficient, and user-friendly applications, primarily using React, Angular, Node.js, AWS, SQL, and Python — combining technical precision with thoughtful design.

When I’m not coding, you’ll probably find me reading about new tech trends, playing chess, or spending time with my family, who keep me active and grounded.
