I am a software engineer focused on technological innovation, driven by a desire to understand how systems work and to develop solutions that combine efficiency, functionality, and value for users.
I specialize in developing tools for analysis and monitoring. My tech stack includes React.js, Angular, TypeScript, AWS, Python, and PostgreSQL, and I am constantly learning to incorporate new technologies and best practices into my work.
My goal is to develop technological solutions that make life simpler, more connected, and more meaningful.
