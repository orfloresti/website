Hi, I'm Orlando Flores Teomitzi (orfloresti) — an engineer focused on technological innovation, driven by a desire to understand how systems work and to develop solutions that combine efficiency, functionality, and value for users.

My main focus is on building tools for analysis and monitoring. My tech stack includes React.js, Angular, TypeScript, AWS, Python, and PostgreSQL, and I’m constantly learning to incorporate new technologies and best practices into my work.
